# modubot-sim

This repository contains files relevant to simulation of the modubot robot at HackRVA.

## Running the Simulation

In order to use this repository ROS and Gazebo must be installed. Installation natively on Ubuntu is simple enough by use of apt-get. Installation on other systems natively may be possible but use of Docker will generally be simpler, even on other Linux Distros.

For Ubuntu installation instructions see [the instructions at the ROS website](http://wiki.ros.org/jade/Installation/Ubuntu).

For Docker install directions see [Docker.md](docs/Docker.md).
