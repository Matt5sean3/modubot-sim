# modubot-sim

This repository contains files relevant to simulation of the modubot robot at HackRVA.

As the package is currently constructed, this should be cloned into an existing catkin workspace. Details on creating a catkin workspace are on the [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace). Currently this is being setup to operate using ROS Indigo, but will likely migrate to Kinematic once it has released.

## Running the Simulation

In order to use this repository ROS and Gazebo must be installed. Installation natively on Ubuntu is simple enough by use of apt-get. Installation on other systems natively may be possible but use of Docker will generally be simpler, even on other Linux Distros.

For Ubuntu installation instructions see [the instructions at the ROS website](http://wiki.ros.org/jade/Installation/Ubuntu).

For Docker install directions see [Docker.md](docs/Docker.md).
